- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Webpack
- Linters
- Jest
- React Library
- Redux

## Live Demo


## Prerequisites

- Interactions
  - Home page
    - When the page loads, the webapp shows the list of categories that could be filtered out by some parameter, for example by the category name.
    - Along with the category name, you will display some numeric values per category that come from the API.
    - When the user clicks (or taps) on a category item, the application navigates to the details page.

  - Details page
    - In the details page, the webapp retrieves data from the API to show detailed data in the category.
    - When the user clicks on the "Back" button (<), the user navigates to the home page.

- Testing requirements
  - Create unit tests for pure functions in your Redux code.
  - Create integration tests for your application using the React Testing Library.
    - You may need to mock the access to the API, so that your tests don't send actual requests.
    - You may need to mock the connection to the Redux Store.

- Technical requirements
  - The project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Redux.
  - The data retrieved from the API should be stored in the Redux store.
  - You should filter the data that you retrieve from the API using a Filter stateless component.
  - Every page (the main page and the pages for each item) should have a unique route within the SPA.
  - The project should be deployed and accessible online (add a link to the online version of your app to your README file.
